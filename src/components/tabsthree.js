            <h3>Systems Administrator</h3>
            <p>Everi Holdings Inc., formerly GCA in Las Vegas, Nevada</p>
            <p>After the biotech company closed down, I had to expand my job search to other nearby States. Las Vegas was the first to call, so I packed up and moved there. Everi is the provider of casino ATM machines, you may have seen them here at Talking Stick. At Everi, I was a part of massive IT team resposible for a multi-million dollar IT infratructure. We had separate teams for Security, Network, Desktop Support, Database Admins, and I was part of the Systems Admin team. We had an in-house Software Dev team as well. With over 300 virtual servers hosted on VMware to maintain at one of the largest and most sophisticated datacenters in the world, Switch. I had the pleasure of occassionally going to Switch at 2 am for maintenance. The SysAdmin role 
is the same. We handle Windows Server Roles and whatever was hosted on it.</p>
            <br></br>
            
            <h5>Major Milestones:</h5> <p>Passed security checks to access Switch data center, implemented Microsoft Lync (which is now Skype of Business). Joined the Change Control committee to assist with server side topics, got my hands on VMware ESXi. Learnt the importance of working within a large team, but that was also not a positive thing for growth, so wanted to try something else.
