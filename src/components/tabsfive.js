            <p>
            It was hard for me to land a job in Tucson, Arizona. I even tried to sell 401k plans for a moment. I stumbled onto driving for Uber and to my surprise, I had the potential to make anywhere from $20-$30 per hour on average and during special events or dates, it can go as high as $40-$50 per hour. For example, I made $50 per hour during New Year's Eve. I stuck with Ubering ever since. I'm always a techy, so that never went away and I worked on personal projects that required my IT skills. On August 1, 2020, I was driving for Uber and was hit head on by a drunk driver. The accident totaled my car and nearly killed me. While I was hurt, I had a lot of time to contemplate on my next move. I wanted to get back into IT again. I wanted to learn Cloud Computing and Web Development to enhance my skills.</p>

                <h5>Major Milestones: </h5>
                <p>Completed a 7 hour course on AWS Cloud Solutions and a 54 hour course on Full-stack Web developement. I have a free tier account with AWS to spinup Windows 2019 instances to repolish my Server Admin skills. Configured my virtual private cloud to host a website on an S3 using AWS SSL, Route53, and CloudFront. In fact, this website is hosted on AWS on my free tier. Prior to the web dev course, I was only able to use website builders, but now I can code websites and web apps from scratch.
