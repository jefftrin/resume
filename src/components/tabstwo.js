            <h3>Sr. Systems Administrator and Promoted to Assistant IT Manager</h3>
            <p>Sangart, Inc. in Mira Mesa, California</p>
            <p>This was an opportunity of a life time, considering I started my IT career just 3 years prior. I was now part of a
            small IT team to help a biotech startup. For a small company of 120 users, we had a fairly big budget for IT, so I got my
            hands on a lot of tech including scientific software and equipment. As a Sr. SysAdmin, I held the responsibility to help
            maintain several physical and Hyper-V servers on premise and network components. Maintained Active Directory and the essential Windows Server Roles.
            My knowledge with SharePoint exceled as I helped install and configure the servers. Implement Group Policies and coordinate with auditors to
            maintain GxP compliant standards. Maintain data backups and coordinate offsite storage with Iron Mountain. Mentor 2 help desk personnel and provide backup support.
            We managed office phone system as well as mobile devices with AT&T. Servers were mostly SuperMicro and Dell and desktops were Lenovo.</p>
            <br></br>
            
            <h5>Major Milestones:</h5> <p>A promotion to Assistant IT Manager. In my new role, I maintained my usual responsibilities
            with additional responsibilities in budgets, product license management, vendor coordination, and job interviews of potential candidates. Implemented Microsoft Lync (now Skyp for Business) and user training classes.

With most biotechs, the research is costly and finding funding is uncertain from year to year. The research had to be shutdown due to insufficient funding.
