                desktops, and a few Windows servers on premise. Exchange, Blackberry, Backup Exec, network components and point of contact to initiate remote assistance with software developers, where I got my feet wet in SQL.
                Basic support of Konica Minolta MFPs and coordinate with multiple vendors for support.</p>

                <p>Coordinated a build out of a second office. Coordinated a training room build out and installed a training database of accounting software.
                Installed and configured Sharepoint when it was still new in the market. The financial crisis of 2008 had me searching for other opportunities. Eventually the bank closed down.
