            <h3>Systems Administrator</h3>
            <p>Agilitec IT in Las Vegas, Nevada</p>
            <p>
            This opportunity was different than what I was accustomed to. Agilitec is a managed IT service provider, so I drove around all over the city to assist small to medium size businesses such as law firms, dentists, optometrist, physicians, and restaurants, just to name a few. In this role, I really learned how to be agile, hence the name. Supporting several different network and devices and servers, including cloud based systems such as Office 365 and migration to Office 365. Lots of Hyper-V and VMware environments and phone systems. Zendesk ticketing system with external users. The goal was to get everyone on the same products as much as possible, so I did a lot of imaging. When new clients onboard, we do a lot of house cleaning within the clients' server racks.</p>

                <h5>Major Milestones: </h5>
                <p>First time helping a restaurant with their IT infrastructure. Not just any resturant, this was Wolfgang Puck's chains and I saw the chef himself.
                Learnt the importance of working with all sorts of technology and being able to adapt quickly to meet the demands of external users,
                which is totally different and was new to me. My personal relationship had us pack up and move to Tucson, Arizona.
